TODO:

GUI:
* Grey out park gear when appropriate.
* Grey out speed changing when simulation is running. 
* Add popup graph pane that can pane graphs on data gathered from the simulation. 
* Tie in sounds (if set) into the click/unclick of the button. 

GUI/Animation:
* Add pressure bars to the speed/pressure values being reported.

GUI/Simulation binding:
* Initial parameters do nothing when you set them.

Animations:
* Need more tiretrack svg's for various traction loss levels. (only two exist)
* Need to add car wobble for the traction loss levels.
* Need to add the final animaion of complete traction loss.

Simulation:
* Need to calculate new traction/speed values for each engine tick and make the information avaliable
to the appropriate entitys. 

Simulation/Animation binding:
* Need to take in the traction values and map it to different animations, including change of car
wheel rpm, traction loss level animations.

Engine:
* Figure out issue with background wrapping. 

EHB:
* We need to add an example EHB software package, right now it's very basic.

Interfaces:
* We need to create a sound enum.
