TODO:

Questions for Tuseday:
* Should the speed only be enterable upon initial startup and if not then what should occur when the user pauses
the simulation and then changes the speed. 
* Should their be a delay from the pressure being set to the pressure being activated. Currently it's done
immidiately in the simulations. 
* Are our interfaces correct.
.. Add more here, this is all I had. 

Bugs (most important):
* I found bad states the simulation can go into when stress testing the GUI, this is the most important bullet point
in the todo as:
#**No combination of the GUI's input and the EHB's interaction with the interfaces should cause the simulation
to go into a bad state.**
* Tiretrack animations/wobble do not work in reverse (simple fix)
* Speed gauge does not work in reverse (simple fix)

GUI/Simulation binding:
* Data from simulation needs to be plotted on graph(s)/update real time. 

Simulation:
* ? Not sure if there was anything else

EHB:
* Add example to show what happens when you incorrectly apply pressure. 

Presentation/Release:
* Need powerpoint
* Need to produce java docs for the interfaces.
* Need way to package and deliver library, either through interfacable jar, pre-made intellij/eclipse projects, or build scripts.

Optional:
* Fix the clouds so their speed is correct given their perspective. 
* Impove traction loss animations/add variety
