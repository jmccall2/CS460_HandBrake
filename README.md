# CS460_EHB_Simulation_Environment


Simulation environment for the EHB software.

## EHB Package
* All files created, and code written for the EHB software should be located in the ehb package.
* You will be provided an empty shell class called EHB.java, inside said class there is a method called update. This method will be called at 60 times a second, and should not contain any loops as it will lock up the entire simulation.


## Interfaces
* The only external package you have access to is the interfaces package which contains the interfaces/drivers and public data structures (enum).
* NOTE: These are static classes so you do not and should not create an instance of any of the interfaces. All methods are static you can call them immediately. 
* Documentation for the interfaces can be found here: https://jmccall2.github.io/CS460_EHB_Simulation_Environment/

## Interface Use Examples:
```java
boolean active = ButtonInterface.isDown(); # Example how to check if the button is currently pressed down.
ButtonInterface.play(ButtonSoundTypes.ENGAGED); # Example how to play a sound, this is played immediately.
ButtonInterface.setColor(ButtonColorTypes.RED); # Example how to set the color, this is changed immediately.
BrakeInterface.setPressure(50); # Set brake pressure, the simulation takes this into account right away. 
double speed = SpeedInterface.getSpeed(); # Example how to get the current speed (in meters/second)
GearTypes gear = GearInterface.getGear(); # Example how to get the current gear. 
```
