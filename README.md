TODO:

Bugs (most important):
* I found bad states the simulation can go into when stress testing the GUI, this is the most important bullet point
in the todo as:#**No combination of the GUI's input and the EHB's interaction with the interfaces should cause the simulation
to go into a bad state.**

* The sun follows the car onto the land 


Simulation:
* ? 

EHB:
* Add example to show what happens when you incorrectly apply pressure. *High pressure should be applied at low speeds and low pressure at high speeds* 


Presentation/Release:
* No powerpoint for the presentation: focus on showing the interfaces and the demo EHB package so they know how to 
inteface with it. And then demo using the GUI/running the simulation. 
* Need to produce java docs for the interfaces.
* Need way to package and deliver library, either through interfacable jar, pre-made intellij/eclipse projects, or build scripts.

Stretch:
* Fix the clouds so their speed is correct given their perspective. 
* Impove traction loss animations/add variety
* When the user presses the brake display the distance traveled real time while the brake is pressed, then when the
brake is unpressed stop updating the distance and leave it in the text box until the user engadges the brake again. 
* Worse wobble while in reverse.
